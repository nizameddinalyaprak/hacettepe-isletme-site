            Undergraduate Program</h2>

            Purpose</h3>
        <p>Our undergraduate program, which has been accepting students since 1976 and delivering education in English
            since 1990, is grounded in nearly half a century of accumulated knowledge and experience. With a structure
            that brings together diverse disciplines such as Law, Accounting-Finance, Organizational Behavior,
            Marketing, Quantitative Methods, Production Management, and Management-Organization, our program aims to
            deliver a dynamic and contemporary education. Its fundamental goal is to cultivate individuals who are
            capable of critical inquiry, eager to learn, and open to experience.</p>
        <p>The discipline of Business Administration holds an important place in the rapidly changing and increasingly
            competitive nature of the business world. From this perspective, one of the most important objectives of our
            department is to prepare students to adapt to different conditions, not shy away from competition, take
            initiative, and exercise leadership. The academic education provided in the department lays the foundation
            for this. Additionally, enhancing our students' communication skills, developing a spirit of teamwork and
            solidarity, expanding their problem-solving capacities, and instilling innovative thinking are among the
            primary goals of our curriculum.</p>

            Program Structure</h3>
        <p>The duration of our undergraduate program is four years, excluding the preparatory year. Our program consists
            of 65% compulsory and 35% elective courses. All courses to be taken in the first two years are compulsory.
            These courses cover areas that form the foundation of business studies—such as management, organizational
            behavior, marketing, and accounting—as well as statistics, mathematics, and law, providing students with a
            general perspective, way of thinking, and theoretical framework. In the third year, five out of twelve
            required courses are elective. Core disciplines such as finance and production management are compulsory,
            while elective courses are available in human resources, sales and marketing, quantitative methods, and law.
            In the final year, eleven out of twelve courses are elective. Numerous elective courses are offered across
            all the above-mentioned fields. In this way, as our students approach graduation, they can select courses
            aligned with the industries, sectors, and fields they plan to work in, and gain the opportunity to develop
            expertise in those areas.</p>
        <p>While compulsory courses ensure students develop theoretically and conceptually, elective courses prioritize
            the evaluation of current and global topics, events, and phenomena. Case studies, presentations, company
            analyses, group projects, and simulations are the most commonly used methods in elective courses. The
            content and delivery of our elective courses play a significant role in developing our students' social
            skills and creating a distinguishing advantage.</p>

            Student Exchange Programs</h3>
        <p>Our department is one of the most active departments in the Erasmus+ program at our university. With
            bilateral agreements with more than twenty European universities, our program regularly sends students
            abroad and accepts students from abroad. Additionally, two other student exchange programs are operated
            within our department: Mevlana (international) and Farabi (national).</p>
        <p>For more information about the Erasmus+ exchange program, please visit the Erasmus page under the exchange
            programs tab.</p>

            Internship Opportunities</h3>
        <p>Although there is no mandatory internship program in our department, students are encouraged to undertake
            internships. For this purpose, two elective courses are offered each academic semester: MAN 327 for
            third-year students and MAN 437 for fourth-year students. Students who complete an internship during the
            summer period can enroll in these courses and gain the opportunity to evaluate the similarities or
            differences between the theory and practice of business from an academic perspective.</p>
