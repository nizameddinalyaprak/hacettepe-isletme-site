            About the Program</h3>
        <p>The Department of Business Administration at Hacettepe University has been offering a PhD program since 1974.
            The aim of the doctoral program is to ensure that students acquire the necessary theoretical and scientific
            knowledge in their area of specialization, conduct independent and ethical research, examine scientific
            findings and events from a broad and in-depth perspective, reach new syntheses, develop universally valid
            new methods, and produce new knowledge.</p>
        <p>Our PhD program, in addition to offering theoretical and applied courses covering all disciplines of business
            administration, provides students with opportunities to engage in scientific research and be involved in
            academic studies—and requires them to do so. Our faculty members and entire academic staff are recognized
            nationally and internationally, follow the most current developments in academic curricula, apply these to
            their teaching programs, and closely monitor student development.</p>
        <p>In the University Research Laboratory's "State Universities and Faculties Ranking," which ranks state
            universities and their faculties in Turkey based on academic incentive performance, our Department of
            Business Administration ranked first in the "Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences / Business
            Administration / Economics / Management Sciences Ranking" in 2020 with the highest score. This ranking
            evaluated the academic performance of faculty members covering project, research, publication, design,
            exhibition, patent, citation, paper, and award activity types, certifying the quality of our department's
            academic staff.</p>
        <p>Our doctoral program is open to all students who wish to specialize in different areas of business, conduct
            scientific studies in these fields, and who are curious, enthusiastic, and possess strong analytical and
            interpretive skills.</p>
